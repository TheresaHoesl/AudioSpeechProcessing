# AudioSpeechProcessing
Projects to course EQ2321 "Audio and Speech Processing"
The course covered: 
1. The source-filter model: analysis-synthesis architecture.
2. Source coding: scalar and vector quantization, redundancy removal, linear prediction, open loop and closed loop coding, coding noise buildup, coding noise shaping, coding gain.
3. Speech and audio coding: vocoders, low bit rate and high bit rate codecs, perceptual audio coding, psychoacoustic principles.
4. Speech and audio signal enhancement, minimum mean square error estimation, linear estimation for Gaussian distribution, Wiener filtering, power spectral subtraction methods, spectral band replication, etc.
